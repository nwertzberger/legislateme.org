LegislateMe.org
----------------------------
This site is about educating the US public about what the senate is voting on
at any given time, and it was started as a result of me not being able to find
any easy to digest info about what the legislature was doing at any given time.

And since the legislature is the one that passes the laws, this seems to be a
problem.
